Static site generator. Combines react webpack, react-router, GraphQL and others. Works a little like create-react-app but without some of the deploying headaches. 
It can take data from json like React but also can use this clever markdown form that I'm typing in, and display it how I've asked it too on the website. Great for blogs and notes, maybe even portfolios. It has great documentation and apparently sites built using it are very, very fast. Even though I've never learnt any GraphQL this seemed understandable. Maybe GraphQL is next! 
It also has loads of prebuilt starters like this, so maybe my next website will be a gatsby one.
